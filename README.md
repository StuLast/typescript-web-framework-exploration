# Typescript Web Framework Exploration

## Status:  WIP!

This is very much a work in progress and is not yet complete.  However, I've found some interesting approaches to building and growing the modules and codebase, looking particularly at code reusability and dependency injection.

##  What's this all about?@

 With so many JS based frameworks kicking about (React, Vue and Angular, to name a few), I've started a project to explore the concepts of how such frameworks are structured, in particular looking at how Typescript (my new favorite coding practice) helps programmers consistently build code with far fewer "dumb mistake" bugs.

 It's also as much about keeping my dev skills sharp and up to date.

##  Why typescript?

Typescript was released by Microsoft in 2012.  Typescript seeks to fix some of the shortcomings of Javascript, in particular loose typing, which can lead to many "dumb mistake" bugs in code.  By defining the expectations of a piece of code before we write the code, we can catch many of those "dumb mistakes" before they even make it into a build.  For me, Typescript turns Javascript into a "grown up developers" language, enforcing good coding practices.  It's a real pleasure to work with, especially if you come from a background of more strict languages, such as C++.
